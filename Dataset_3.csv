We all checked the bike's capacity to be 150 km's ( for 1 full charge). now its given only 80 who the hell wants to pay 1 lakh for just 80 km's. We don't need max speed for 70 km. Just 40 km/hr. is more than enough. For better safety. How many accidents need to happen . Worst experience if you expect me to say. Felt cheated.,Daily Commute,Never owned,,1,3,4,,,,4,,1,TVS iQube
Performance is very poor on this bike. The charging problem is a very big thing. Worth money. Don't spend the money on this bike. My bike is standing in the service center of tvs iqube for a long time. I am very disappointed. Nobody can hear me because I purchased this bike. I want to sell this bike as soon as possible.,Everything,> 1 yr,< 5000 kms,1,3,1,,1,,3,,3,TVS iQube
"I purchased this in April 2022 and the sales staff was clueless about the new vehicle launch in May 2022. I asked specifically if there is a new model coming but they had no idea.
The scooter is well built and has good features but compared to other ev scooters, it lacks a lot. The most important lacking is its range. The offered range is 75 km/charge but the real range in eco mode is approx 50km. It's a huge setback considering there are models in other brands which cost the same but offer a better range. I would advise anybody looking to buy this vehicle to first consult with existing owners.",Daily Commute,< 3 months,< 5000 kms,3,4,4,,2,,5,,2,TVS iQube

"Don't buy this vehicle unless you have a near by tvs iqube service center. You will not get service in any other tvs service centers and there is not many service centers over the country. And you will lose your warranty benefits for any delay in servicing the vehicle.

After that rode for 400 kms bike suddenly stopped.

"The tvs iqube is supposed to be a game changer for tvs in its ev debut but sadly it is let down by step motherly treatment by tvs itself.
Buying was problematic as tvs as chosen only 4-5 showrooms in all of bangalore to sell iqube. For some reason, showrooms are not enthusiastic about giving test ride, following up, picking calls etc. All the push needs to come from the customer side till they get vehicle delivery. Looks like tvs itself in not eager about selling iqube in big numbers.
The iqube rides very well in city conditions and like a very conventional scooter minus the petrol engine noise and vibrations. No complaints there. No hassles with pillion rider either.
Build quality is not great ..Plastic feel throughout and not the nice kind as well. Gaps between panels are clearly visible. The key fob is a prime example of giving flashiness the upper hand over quality. Mine simply split into two after a few days.
Charging time takes 6-7 hours for 10% to 100% and gives upto 75km riding distance. Good for short distance rides. Charger price is extra, which is plain dumb considering every ev should have a charger in its package. The most cheapest electronic product ships with a charger and tvs chose not to. Clearly the accessory pays more gimmick. Also charging point needs a good earthing presence else vehicle cannot be charged. You will not find this mentioned in showroom.
Vehicle maintenance is not much, just keep tires inflated and use water to clean and that's all it takes.
But the onus is on the owner to keep the vehicle problem-free because iqube service centers are very few and you cannot get it repaired in local garages. You are at the mercy of the tvs service center which can repair it. Tvs having so much local presence already should have at least ensured that iqube can be repaired at any service center. Again this feels deliberate. My nearest service center for iqube is nearly 15 km away but there are more than 8 tvs service centers on the way which do not deal with iqube. Also spares are not compatible with any of their other products.
Another thing is that tvs itself seems perplexed with many of the random things that the scooter does. My vehicle shows up with a ""close throttle warning"" at starting and tvs has not been able to tell why that comes and what the solution is. The only so called solution is to twist the throttle and leave it and hope the warning goes away. Clearly the sensor calibration is what the issue is but they want customer to change the way they drive to solve their problem. I have heard another user say sometimes the battery indicator shows 0% even if there is enough charge and need to restart the vehicle.
Pros:
- decent ev for someone whose daily travel is 50km and has charging facilities at home.
- very good motor. Zippy, zero noise, responsive.
- great handling and suspension and good ground clearance.
- not complicated to use at all even with lots of electronic features.
- easy to maintain.
Cons:
- reliability - range anxiety of ev aside, you never know which sensor might get knocked off on the iqube and the vehicle gets bricked (keep towing services number handy). Tvs should do more customer interaction to know the regular problems faced by users and only then they can solve.
- serviceability is poor. Customer service almost has no knowledge of the scooter working and their only response is to ask the service center to call you.
- takes way to long to charge.
- there is no concept of software upgrade. Awful app.
There is a lot of work for tvs to do with iqube if it wants to be considered a serious ev player. Otherwise, this model will just be a footnote in the ev revolution.",Occasional Commute,6 months-1 yr,< 5000 kms,3,3,2,,2,,4,,3,TVS iQube
"I brought iqube in march 2021 used for about 1400 kms and the motor is dead, The vehicle was dropped at prn motors and its been 25 days now and still the replacement is not done, the display is a waste in the bike, Maps don't work, at least clock I expected and that too is not working. Totally I wasted on such a waste bike. Please don't buy ev scooters with motor in wheel its always a headache.",Daily Commute,< 3 months,< 5000 kms,1,3,1,,1,,2,,1,TVS iQube
"Buying experience - Chennai on road price is 115580/- but they are charging hefty amount on charger cable. Simple charger cable with industrial socket they have priced it as Rs.8260 which should be priced only Rs.2000/- to Rs.3000/-. Tvs has maintained vehicle price equal to competitor but huge margin in chargers and accessories.
Ride comfort with pillion is good and it can be used only for fixed distance usage, like only commuting to office and back to home.
When 100% charged vehicle pick up is good and top speed achieved under power mode 84 km/h, in eco mode top speed is only 52 kmh. But when the power is at less than 70%, eco mode top speed is 44 to 46 km/h only. As per my experience under combination eco & power mode 68% and 32% respectively, the range achieved is 71.9 km with balance 9% charge which shows distance to empty is 7km so approx. total range is 78.9 km. The above range is with regenerative option but we could not see how much regenerative power generated in %, app do not provide any data
Very poor app design and bt connectivity issue continues and reports are not generated for a selected period.
Unnecessarily head light is permanently ""on"", even thought there is one drl, horn sound is worst and not good. They should provide ntorq horn which is louder and good.
Charging time is huge and it takes 6 hours to charge from 9% to 100%, tvs should come out with replaceable battery at least for the under seat battery so we can buy one spare battery and we can use it as reserve power back up option.
The app should provide the details for every trip how much power % consumed and while charging it should provide how much units consumed for every charge
Servicing and maintenance experience not able to comment we have wait and watch, tvs should provide improvements as stated above once they fix the issue to all existing customers especially removable battery option.",Daily Commute,< 3 months,< 5000 kms,3,3,3,,3,,4,,3,TVS iQube

How good the TVS iQube EV scooter is a very much premature stage to claim how good it is in the field conditions. But some of the points to be looked can be discussed as follows. Battery - with it’s 2.2 kw battery it’s more than enough in city ride conditions say for everyday commute. With this power iqube offers a range of 75 km/h which is slightly better than Chinese rebadged scooters from other competitors. Motor power of 4.5 kw offers a better acceleration of 0–40kmph in 4.2 seconds which is slightly better too given the other competitors. A kerb weight of 118 kgs offer better dynamic riding conditions. With the low price tag next to Chetak as 1.15 lakhs is literally a competitive priced EV scooter in India than Ather and other vehicles. A charging time of 4–5 hours is enough for a day's ride with average city riding office to home commute. With geo-fencing and other loaded options vehicle looks cooler and slim compared to the others in market. Personally i would say the final performance and acceptability verdict is to be given by the sales numbers alone. That will really show how good the acceptance rate of the vehicle is.

"We'll, this bike will meet the interests of many Indians, in many factors, excluding a few like riding range and speed. But still, if you're daily riding range is less than 130-120 kms and able to maintain an idle speed of 60 to 70 km/h, then this bike will serve you the best. In terms of braking, combined braking system is provided and it's performing just as much as required. Ergonomics are good, comfort factor is well prioritized by the makers. The bluetooth connectivity is an interesting element which grabs the attention of the youth. Although there are plenty of features on the app which are necessary in the present day, but the throttle sound feature was awesome. That's the feature which makes the bike special when compared to the other ev's in the nation. In terms of electrical vehicles it's worthy to get a new bike as early as possible. The main reason is, governments are encouraging, fuel prices are peaking (even if they get back to normal, prices will rise in the near future), and it's always good to get adapted with the changes.

Awesome ergonomics, built quality looks premium.Although it is an electric bike its safer for our environment also, so i congratulate revolt to bring the future in our reach.

Even built quality also never compromised by revolt.4) high-tech apps features (not all features are disclose as of now, so there should be more premium features letter on ) ex- geo fensing , exhaust sound change , keyless , and riding modes.5) swapping station and battery delivery concept.6) lifetime battery warranty.7) unlimited service by revolt under mrp(my revolt plan).8) though its an electric bike the lower end pick up is heavily high.9) usd(up-side down forks).10) led head drls & projector head lamp.11) led tell lamp.15) fast charging (75% charge in 2.5hour / full charge 4-4.5 hour).16) can be charge at any place with an 15mm port.17) can run up to 150km after one charge.18) cost efficient.Cons:-1) there is no abs.2) lack of speed. (max speed 80km/h)3) weight carrying capacity. (not more than 150kg)4) battery weight is too heavy almost 19-20kg. They said if your bike run out of battery then you can carry the batter charge it and put it back and you good to go. But i don't think it is to carry 20kg.5) it is an electric bike so its initial pick up is very high so you need to be very concerned while rev the acceleration.6) the engine power could be more powerful , overall you making a bike not scooter.(personal opinion).7) bike looks great but very compact which make this look like a toy.8) additional body graphics is missing which i believe can be added.9) the bike has no exhaust sounds, but there is a speaker which produce artificial exhaust sound and it totally understandable that the sound is artificial.Now the questions:-1) should i buy this bike ??Ans :- of course..

3. No doubt there are alot of new features being show cased like remote controlled, push start button, operating bike from mobile phone, changing sound, geo fencing. I believe other features like DRLs are quite common features which are available in every bike now a days.
At the time of taking the test drive of this bike, i was told that you can only start the bike either from a remote or mobile phone and not from a key. They could not answer when I asked them how to start the bike if remote stopped working and my mobile phone is out of battery.
Although, sound coming out from the speaker is an interesting feature, however, maximum sound in itself is not at all loud and thrilling.
My overall experience with representatives at Revolt Showroom was very bad as they were neither welcoming nor were aware about the complete specifications of the bike nor could answer to my queries.
Cannot say much about the ride quality or performance of the bike because representatives only let me ride the bike in a service lane just for 2-3 minutes.
I would give an overall rating of 3 stars to this bike and my overall experience.",Daily Commute,Never owned,,3,3,3,3,3,,3,,,Revolt RV 400

"The biggest issue before going electric is range and performance. The bike is below mediocre in both. Stated range of 100 km is not enough. If we travel 30km to and fro add to it the loss of inefficiency we are staring at 70-80 kms range which would put battery to its limits since stated range is always far fetched. Now lets add realistic assumptions. 1-the sub tropical climate of india with scorching summers of 40+ radically affects battery life and range over years. We are starting at 70% efficiency within 2-3 years at best. Though the decline after initial fall would be slower. Typical reason why most manufacturers prefer liquid cooling for battery. If they don’t for cost savings, stay away for you will pay in future. 2-the battery life also depends on its peak charge and its lower extremity over repeated use. Maintaining a charge of 80% as max would be suitable most of the time and so for downsides of 20% that limits the battery charge usable to 60% for regular days. 60% of 100km - inflated statement (assume 20%) - 2-3 years degradation We are already staying at range of 40-60 kms depending on individuals driving habits and use case. I would happily pay a premium for electric is performance parameters are atleast at par with regular bikes from range to top-speed. I fully understand the economics under play and rate of returns and current bikes of range 100-150 are not worth it. Add to it their limited to speed and rigidity. Waiting for 4th gen products. Remember what happened with smart phones. We barely recall what first few generations looked like until they are good enough to attract our attention.

"Buying experience: not great. While booking the bike, the price was 1.38lacs ( on-road price). They called me after 2 months, and when I asked about the manufacture date, they said it's the last year, I refused to take it. Again I got a call in may to make the payment, for which I paid rs. 1.49 lacs. They said: 1 bike chips are in high demand and 2. Bike prices increased. Now the latest price is rs. 1.51 lacs. They even don't offer a glass of water to their customers forget offering tea/coffee. Once you made the payment, they are taking you for granted.
2. Riding experience: this bike is not fit if your height is less than 167cm. The seat is too hard, and the max. Weight it carries 130 kgs. The riding quality is good.
3. Details about looks, performance etc: looks wise it is good, after you purchase the bike, you need to buy an additional stabilizer ( compulsory) which you need to invest around 3k more.

Cons: they provide an additional bill, which doesn't have any gst number, it is just about balancing the extra payment you made. You need to pay for every additional screw. Nothing free here.",Daily Commute,> 1 yr,< 5000 kms,3,4,3,4,3,3,,3,,Revolt RV 400
"So here's something to ponder and consider before you make a purchase of the revolt rv 400.
I had the terrible misfortune of having booked and fully paid for the electric bike.
1. For one, the delivery of the bike is delayed and after claiming 100% amounts in advance
2. But, what I found ridiculous is the following facts:
Did you know they try and sell you an insurance cover, which is much higher priced?
Well, they do and so I got my own insurance and they had to minus the amounts, which they would have otherwise charged
Did you know they literally force down your throats a sub-standard helmet, which is much higher priced, than any helmet currently available on the market?
Now here is what baffled me no end!
The director at koramangala, bangalore, tells me that, he will not deliver my bike unless I, either take the revolt sub-standard helmet at a higher price or produce a recent invoice showing the purchase of a helmet.
Anyways, since I did not like or want the revolt helmet, I proceeded to make a purchase of a helmet I liked.
Then I am told that I need to give them a 'printed' tax invoice.
Now the attachment is the tax invoice that the seller was able to generate; but according to him, this won't do.
So when did a start-up brand in India dictate which helmet I need to use?
What happens if someone already has a better helmet. They cannot get the bike?
When was it that, a start-up brand began forcing us customers to buy anything?
This seems unlawful and must be addressed immediately.
Last but not the least, I do believe a brand will achieve far more with someone better equipped and knowledgeable.",Daily Commute,< 3 months,< 5000 kms,1,,,,,,,,,Revolt RV 400

"Bajaj Chetak has increased the price of their electric scooter for second time without any noticeable up gradation. The first hike was Rs.5000/- and thereafter a whopping hike of Rs.27000/- in March 2021.”Bajaj” is exploiting the trust of Indian customers who are having great faith in this brand. On the contrary, the manufacturer has little sentiments for their trusted customer and encashing every opportunity to swallow the subsidy amount and hard earned money of the buyers. As a thumb rule the production cost goes down with increase in production volume. Then why so frequent and intense price hikes? this is not only the story of Bajaj Chetak, every second electric scooter that gain slightest popularity has adopted the similar strategy, like Ather-450x who did raise a few months back. They have no ethics, no sentiments for environment, country or people. I appeal to general public to boycott their products, there are many other great options available in Indian market, and we just need to give a fair trial to many other new manufacturers.

"I booked ola just to get a test ride by paying an advance of 500. I should say I was bowled over when I did the test ride. I was not serious to buy ola but then when they gave the gerua colour offer on holi, i bought it. From the date of full payment, I got the vehicle in about a month's time. Everything was done through the app. Updates were coming as notifications. However, there was no way to know the real-time information about the delivery status. It was carefully packed while delivering but the number plate was already bent.
It is the silence during the ride that I like the most. No sound from the motor, just the new tyre sounds. Pickup is amazing. Whenever we decide we can easily accelerate and pass other vehicles.
The look is the same as etergo the netherland scooter. The only con with the looks is that it looks like a scooty and not a scooter. The under-seat capacity is good enough to hold my laptop if I leave the charger and other items behind. The range is about 90 km. There was a sudden drop to 0 in just 10 seconds and the vehicle switched off when the range was still showing 45 km. They claim a true range of 135 km for s1 pro but that is not true. I had to get that towed to my home taking their roadside assistance but it took me 6 hours to get the scooter home. I am doing a hard reset of the s/w as instructed by them every other day so that the display will show the right range. There will be a loss of about 5% battery every night when you are not charging. There is a slight lag in the pickup initially but then it moves fast. The reverse mode gives a push and doesn't respond for a few seconds. Again another push and then gets cut off. It is safer this way compared to the complaints I hear from other customers of over-speeding in the reverse mode and going forward when reversing.
I have not gone for a service or maintenance. It is still new - I have driven about 400 km so far. Their customer care was friendly and helpful. They followed up a couple of times after the issue was resolved. I am still awaiting the upgrade of the software version which will have all the other features that were promised for s1 pro - cruise control, hill control, Bluetooth, navigation, etc. Hyper charging stations are yet to be installed in bangalore. The front shocks are making me worry because there is a noise and there are complaints of this breaking when negotiating speed breakers.
Overall, this is a good and ambitious scooter project which failed miserably. Ola has to re-brand its scooter and earn customer loyalty to remain in the market. Significant pros are the looks, under-seat capacity, and display system. Cons are unfirm rear grips, useless front leg room (you can't keep your grocery box or bag there due to the central hump), flimsy side stand (center stand is not a possibility by design), and not useful for saree-clad women on the rear - no footrest for them, control buttons are difficult to reach.",Occasional Commute,< 3 months,< 5000 kms,3,4,2,4,4,,4,,,OLA S1 Pro

"Got the scooter delivered on Jan 3rd, 2022.
Payment process : was one of the first early adopters - reserved her for 500 on july 23. 2 months later, paid an advance of 20k, and got an invite to take the test ride 15 days later. Paid the final amount in October, and received the delivery window of December 15-31. The ola representative called in December end for final confirmation and soon received the intimation of insurance and registration payment from icici lombard and rto respectively. Home delivered in a mini truck.
Idv on insurance : 155400
Actual cost : 197400 (ex showroom 163549, smart card - 200, postal fee - 50, registration - free, zero dep insurance - 7632, portable charger - 9000, performance upgrade - 17000)
Fame ii subsidy : 59550 (15000 per kwh - 15000*3.97)
Maharashtra state subsidy : 29850 (5000 per kwh - 5000*3.97 = 19850 + 10000 additional)
Total subsidy discount : 89400
Effective on road price : 108000
Real world range : 135 kms in normal, 120 km in sports, 95 km in hyper
Arai claimed range : 181 kms
Design language : a big fan, front leds are as powerful as a dominar's and cute like wall e's face! it's parent company etergo won the german design award in 2020, so there's that too! floorboard isn't flat, but compensates by providing a 36lt boot space, that can fit 2 half face helmets, and 1 full face ls2 ece helmet sideways. Turn indicators chime through the in built speakers. Display is 7"". Stock horn is typical road runner type (90s kids relate?)
Riding : very agile, planted in corners, thick 120 section mrfs provide good grip. Seat height is 790mm and well padded and you sit taller than the traffic (i'm 6 feet). Motor whines while accelerating (it's addictive). The bugs of the beta software have been fixed, and now the scooter runs a stable os.
Performance : 0-40 : 3 seconds, 0-60 : 5 seconds, top speed : 115 kmph, torque : 58nm (accelerates in hyper mode arguably as fast as a dominar 400/ duke 250)
Charging : likes to take it in the ass through a 750w portable charger. Charging time : 6.5 hours. 6amp connection taken from home.
Running costs : 4.54km/rupee or rs. 0.22/km. In comparison, a bike returning 35 km/l at 105/litre equals rs.3/km
Battery warranty : 3 years
Battery life : 7 years (claimed)
Battery replacement cost : Rs. 60000 (info provided by technician, subject to drop in price as adoption increases)
Niggles : delivery date was pushed by 4 days, but guess have to give ola credit for innovation, so no complaints.

"Let's start it from its exterior. The ola s1 pro has got fabric body and the battery part is metallic finish to protect the battery. The ola s1 pro has got all led lights including indicators, headlamp, taillamp and the s1 pro has got 2 led headlamps and you can choose to light up 1 or both. Coming to the touch screen of s1 pro, the touch screen has got all information regarding the s1 pro the speed, battery, km driven, km left to drain battery and also it got a bluetooth connectivity for maps. BTW it has a offline map also for attending calls, cutting the calls. The s1 pro have 2 speakers, could you believe it. You can listen songs by bluetooth connectivity on them and the s1 pro has got a usb socket also and the utlity space on both the knee sides. Now moving on to the top speed of s1 pro. OMG, the first scooter I have ever seen which reaches 110-115 km/h easily. It has got 3 modes normal, sport, hyper. Whenever you switch modes from normal the screen shows you the decreasing battery which is normal. The full capacity of full charge running of s1 pro is approx 180 kms which is awesome. Now let's move to the boot space, It has got very huge boot space. You can easily fit 2 helmets on it. Now moving to the looks, touchwood the ola s1 pro is very good looking and premium scooter. You get alloys and both disc brakes.. In my opinion it is the best smart electric scooter available in India with decent price.. The price of s1 pro is approx 1,20000 INR.

"Bought an ola during the holi window.
Procedural time is understandable. Delivery was pathetic there was a dispute between the transporter and truck owner the vehicle was helped up on the truck for 3 days. The rep was rude but answered the mobile.
Riding the scooter has power alright. Was disappointed there is no navigation preinstalled. The rep says there will be a software update. There is a scraping sound when above 35km/hr also there is a vibration that you can feel on the foot if you wear chappals. Called the company rep and he said to ride for 500km if still there to call customer care. Overhaul I'm concerned about the vibration it's 200km and still, both are there.

The looks of this bike are very much different from other EVs its eye-catching, cool looks with multiple color options to choose from.
Can't talk about the performance.
Now coming to the servicing part I think the OLA is on the trails and errors stage and the base is not set yet to resolve the issues of its riders and customers but I believe that they will come up with the resolutions very soon for the issues which their customers are facing.
Pros-
Firstly it is an EV.
Amazing looks.
Cons-
Launched in Dec-2021 in cold weather, yet to experience till this summer ends that how many more complaints to be seen and also should get ready for Mumbai rainy season to come.
-It Will be more helpful for its riders if they keep the availability of their spare parts and prompt service.

"1. Buying experience: they really made us wait for a very long period, took 2 months more than the promised delivery date.
2. Riding: it is just amazing and the top speed on paper is 115 km/h but in real in turbo mode, it gives a top speed of 70km/h and the charging time is not so much because when we see the range after 100% charging the vehicle it gives a range of 135 kms. The charging time is 7 to 7.30 hours.
3. Looks and performance: amazing looks and superb performance.
4. Pro: ride quality and eco friendly, pick up too good, comfortable for 2 people, has a large boot space, built quality is very good.

A) the functional buttons are very difficult to operate.(horn, turn indicator etc)
B) manual key lock is necessary
C) back number plate often hits the leg
D) side stand quality could have been better.
E) horn sound is very inadequate.
F) in real-life conditions it gives only 100 to 130 kms for one full charge(s1 pro)
F) fast-charging stations and not available
G) you cannot hold the brakes and accelerate the bike.

"I booked s1 pro on dussera 2021 with an expectation to be delivered by the year-end, booking amount was 500 rs so wasn't much wishful, as I booked a tesla model 3 on 2016 which is never delivered in India (1000 usd booking). Anyways was surprised to receive a mail near holi to make final payments and my scooter will be delivered by may end. I was excited and made full payment and they did abide by the promise.
The delivery experience was smooth and coordinated and I faced no hassles in getting delivered at home in nagpur apart from a last-minute glitch of having the wrong scooter delivered but it was an honest mix-up as both same colors and assigned for a similar area. The initial impression of the scooter was very negative, having owned a honda dio for over a decade I was at least expecting my helmet to fit in the trunk which, despite being spacious wasn't the right size for storing my regular-sized helmet. And where is the center stand? it's an absolute must but if they did for the sensor and software issue. At least they had provision for the same and I got an aftermarket stand installed separately.
The driving experience is definitely an upgrade from traditional ice - the ride height, suspension system, dual disc brakes, wide and comfortable seats, and peppy motor make it check all boxes in the ride quality section. Its looks are unique and definitely head turner! software is another matter however ev makes it 40% software and 60% hardware. And the software is buggy - the charge level problems, occasional lags in the interface, and delay in promised updates do not look good on ola's books.
I haven't faced any maintenance needs and do not expect any necessity to service since there aren't any mechanical parts. The range is great and I do manage to get about 135-140 on a single charge as promised true range. Perhaps if I use regen braking more aggressively I may be able to manage more juice out of it, but I don't feel the need since I mostly cruise and only use it for leisure travels.

1. You need to charge it regularly and manage it well. If you can't manage the vehicle by charging it regularly or forget often to charge, don't buy this vehicle.

"This is my honest review after riding for 7500 km and 9 months.
I bought this bike in Aug 2021. The buying experience was not that great, but all that faded out in the excellent performance and quality of this bike. The riding experience was amazing. What I found was Ather has tested this bike in most Indian conditions and it is well suited for Indian roads. Looks are undoubtedly sporty, performance is superb has mentioned in numbers in the website.
I had done one service after 5000 km, it cost me some 1200 rs. No maintenance charges except service.
Pros.
1. Excellent Performance
2. Looks
3. No maintenance except servicing
4. Service cost is low
5. Riding experience
6. Useful OTA updates
Cons.
1. Price is comparatively high
2. Buying experience is not impressive
3. Range is 90 km. Which would have been 150km for the daily commute.",Daily Commute,6 months-1 yr,5000-10000 kms,5,5,5,5,5,,4,,,Ather 450X

Poor material of critical components like motor and battery. I already touched upon initial battery response. After a year, bike is giving less then 30 km on a full charge. The motor of bike has got damaged within a year. Both are covered under 3-year warranty, but support too is horrible. 3. Customer support is horrible.

Bought it amidst lockdown. Congratulations to hero electric for venturing into the field of riding with zero emission. Really appreciate such moves. Riding experience is good. Better suited for single riding rather than double carrying.. The battery of vrla model doesn't charge fully below 12 hours. Moreover the capacity of the motor to perform at battery levels below 30% is really poor. So after a maximum of 40kms one needs to recharge it for full performance.

I handed over my scooter to showroom for diagnose. The problem is still there but still no solution for my scooter by company. I am very disappointed with Rafter company owner and their employees behavior,Daily Commute,6 months-1 yr,5000-10000 kms,1,1,1,,1,,1,,1,Hero Electric Flash
"Worst experience with hero electric scooter. Performance is poor, quality was not up to the mark as expected. With one full charge the scooter is running only 30 km/l. The build quality was also very poor. I was totally disappointed with hero electric scooter. Waste of money and not satisfied with this scooter.",Daily Commute,> 1 yr,< 5000 kms,1,1,1,,1,,1,,2,Hero Electric Flash
"1) Very bad experience while buying something else shown on website regarding offer and when you visit showroom they don't know what we are talking about.
2) Riding experience is totally worst. Everything is made up of plastic and which is of worst quality. Within few months many noises will arise and lock problem which I had to change within 2 months by paying 1200 rs.
3) Looks is not so good compared to petrol bikes and performance is worst. You buy a bike to save money but actually you should have invested in a petrol bike because parts of this bike is costly.
4) Servicing and maintenance is always ready. As soon as you reach the showroom they will say some parts are broken which is not in warranty and ask you to pay, costly to maintain this bike.
5) pros I haven't seen any bike like this. My hard earned money I lost like stupid and I never recommend any one to take this bike.",Daily Commute,6 months-1 yr,5000-10000 kms,1,1,1,,1,,1,,1,Hero Electric Flash
"Very poor experience .I have recently purchased their nyx model from Aditya motors Varanasi ,up .May be he delivered us a defective piece not even 4 months had passed and I renewed almost each every part of it as every parts got damaged on weekly basis, dealer told us that there is no warranty on it. Uncomfortable seats. Very less mileage have written many emails to the company but no replies ,not receiving customer care phone calls also .Even their gift vouchers are also already redeemed one .I will suggest not to buy their any model because in future they are not going to help you in any way.",Daily Commute,> 1 yr,< 5000 kms,1,1,1,,1,,1,,1,Hero Electric Flash
"We purchased hero electric flash from Jindal motors, Khandwa. This dealer is good and best in service but Hero Elecric suddenly changed their dealer.

"I have completed 1020 km's on this bike.100 km's plus per charge is again and again checked and found correct. The odometer always gives a 10 percent less reading than actual. I have taken that also into account in 100 km's range. Hero electric lite is the best ev scooter in India, for the same price, and specifications. Go for this scooter to beat the petrol price and save loads of money. I have no issues in running this scooter.

"Awesome performance. I get 100 km's range with full charge. But I use it for 60 to 70 km's range only. Charging is then for two hours only. The best e bike in India. One charge is less than 1 unit. It's the cheapest mode of transport. Cost of 70 km's ride is approx. 8 rupees, or 10 paisa per km's. The bike needs disc brakes.",Everything,< 3 months,< 5000 kms,5,5,5,,5,,5,,5,Hero Electric Flash
"Awesome bike. I bought the hero flash from e galaxy showroom in pcmc. The sale and service personal are very helpful. I get a range of 100 km's now after riding 750 km's. I don't use the full 100 km's. I charge after every 60 to 70 km's. Charging takes just 2 hour's plus. That's because a lithium ion battery should not be charged 100 percent and should not be drained completely. I let the bike roll as much as it can and I use the throttle sparingly. Look wise the bike has a lovely cute look. I love it. Till now no maintenance. At 100 km's approx. per charge, I will get back my investment in maximum 1 year. I use under 1 unit of electricity per charge. So it's just 10 rupees for 100 km's. Or 10 paisa per km.

When I bought it home it was very silent and felt like a new experience .I don't know why but I got so much excited for that . One of the main reasons I bought that I don't need registration for that and I also don't need insurance and all that stuff. It's like ex showroom price is on road price .It once got stopped and didn't give warning but luckily I was near my home so I charged it . Well it was my fault that I didn't charge it in 7 days .

The customer service is really pathetic. There is no escalation contact. No proper channel to raise complaint. I booked this vehicle and they delivered a defective meter. The showroom says they are not responsible to defect and kerala sales manager is responsible. He never picks calls. Even after 3 months defective meter is not fixed. Please never buy from hero.

1. When i bought this bike it was high value but now this bike is economical.2. Seat is low for man but it is comfortable for women.3. Color of bike is very nice but height of seat is low.4. Servicing of this bike is done well except tube repair is very difficult because a pin is inserted into the tyre then tube is difficult to open for rear wheel . If tyre of rear wheel is solid then it is very good. Motor of rear wheel works difficult to repair.Pros: it is light in weight.Parts are light in weight.Height of this car is convenient for women.Cons: it runs sightly.Parts of this bike is not so strong.Seat of this bike is low height for man.Tyre of rear wheel is not so solid as it necessary.,Daily Commute,> 1 yr,5000-10000 kms,4,4,4,,4,,4,,4,Hero Electric Flash

It cost 5000 rupees to ship your batteries to company and takes minimum 3 months . And more over you have to bare other charges if problem won't find by company. When i called customer service, they gave me rm number, unfortunately they revealed secrets that they don't manufacturer any product like batteries and spares and body parts and body.

"I am intrigued by the smooth, silent and efficient test ride of the flash hero electric vehicle. It was an astonishing experience for me to note that the vehicle fell silent and in stand-by mode at the signal till i accelerated... And the pick up was immediate! an ideal machine for in-town move-abouts. Your ads could be more aggressive. People could be weaned away from the false idea of meaningless speed, wastage of power and money - and the consequent inevitable 'eco-pollutions'...It will be wonderful if its range per charge could be enhanced. I have some innovative ideas for the same. I would be happy to offer my experience & expertise to conduct/ guide some projects in this regard for the company.

"I bought this bike(lead) in june 2019 at 41,000(maybe costlier than now)it is good in looking but it's body is totally plastic. According to me it can't handle more than 130-150 kg of weight for the speed. If you are buying then be careful while driving, i met with an small accident and the condition of the bike was worst due to its plastic body. And one more thing it takes around 8-9 hrs for charging and last till just 30-45 km(not more than that according to me). When it was new there was no footrest for keeping legs but now may be company is allowing.Well it's maintenance is not that hard just to charge and keep it clean. But i recommend to take it to service every 2-3 months because it may cause some break issues.

Used the vehicle for 3 days with out light and indicator due to urgency. Informed dhanya motor again to rectify , they have taken back the vehicle to check. As per them the issue was due to loose connection and they want me to pick up the bike from work shop..... Why should i pick up the bike from their work shop? They are not sure whether issue has been addressed or not. They want me to check and take. I said no... Last 3 days it is lying in the show room.
